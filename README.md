TXtelsig VCO features:
1. High integration and standard package size;
2. Arcade structure of two-stage transistor, small working current, high output power and good isolation;
3. Use high stability oscillating circuit structure, high precision varactor and high output power RF triode to ensure stable starting waveform and high output power
4. The system uses 5V standard voltage for power supply, and the maximum tuning voltage can reach 9V, thus realizing wide-band output;
5. The integrated rectifier filter unit and RF output matching unit only need a few peripheral components and have good output power flatness. The RF output terminal can be directly connected to 500 RF lines, which is convenient to use;
6. The device package adopts 7mm × 9mm × 2mm general package size, which can directly replace the products of the same type in the market.
